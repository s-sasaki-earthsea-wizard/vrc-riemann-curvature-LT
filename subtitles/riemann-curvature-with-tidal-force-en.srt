1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:05,773
What do you think would happen if you dropped two balls side-by-side at the same time?

2
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:10,481
You'd think they'd fall in parallel and never hit each other, right?

3
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:14,395
Actually, strictly speaking, that's not quite right.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:21,412
Exploring this question leads us to the heart of general relativity: the curvature of spacetime.

5
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:27,210
Let's say you're sitting in a chair right now watching this video.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,262
There's a tiny difference in distance from the center of the Earth between your head and your feet.

7
00:00:33,362 --> 00:00:38,690
Since your feet are closer to Earth, they feel a slightly stronger gravity.

8
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:43,905
As a result, your body is actually being stretched vertically.

9
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:47,317
Unless you're watching this while doing a handstand!

10
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:52,481
Of course, this effect is so small it's invisible to the naked eye.

11
00:00:53,333 --> 00:01:01,229
But this stretching, caused by spacetime curvature and tidal forces, is the core of general relativity.

12
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:08,913
Today, let's use this as a clue to intuitively understand what 'spacetime curvature' actually is.

13
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:17,683
Before we dive into curvature and tidal forces, let's consider: what exactly is gravity anyway?

14
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:23,889
What would happen if you were on a plane and the engines suddenly stopped?

15
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:31,493
Inside a plane in freefall, you would experience weightlessness, just like in this video.

16
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:34,161
Everyone looks like they're having fun!

17
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:42,385
This is actually the same principle as why astronauts float inside the Space Station.

18
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:49,789
Because the Space Station is constantly falling around the Earth, those inside feel weightless.

19
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:59,262
To someone in freefall, it feels as if gravity has completely vanished.

20
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:08,756
If you were in a windowless box, you couldn't tell if you were falling, in orbit, or in deep space where gravity is weak.

21
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:21,154
Gravity and acceleration are locally indistinguishable. We call this the equivalence principle.

22
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:26,621
Einstein reportedly called this 'the happiest thought' of his life.

23
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:35,366
But if gravity can be canceled out, doesn't it make you wonder if gravity even truly exists?

24
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:44,198
In fact, there is a 'real' gravitational effect that even freefall cannot eliminate.

25
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,710
That is the tidal force we mentioned earlier.

26
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:56,122
Let's look specifically at what this 'un-cancelable gravity' really looks like.

27
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:02,387
Imagine two balls side-by-side, dropped simultaneously toward the Earth.

28
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:07,214
What would happen to them?

29
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:12,587
They seem like they should fall in parallel and never touch.

30
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:16,862
But strictly speaking, they don't.

31
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:19,578
This is because the Earth is a sphere.

32
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,893
Gravity pulls everything toward the Earth's center.

33
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:32,615
So, both balls fall toward that same center, meaning they slowly drift together and would eventually collide.

34
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:44,331
Now, let's try dropping two balls vertically, one above the other.

35
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,091
Which one falls faster?

36
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:49,615
The answer is the one on the bottom.

37
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:58,253
The ball closer to Earth feels stronger gravity, so it falls faster and the gap between them widens.

38
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,563
The two balls gradually move further apart as they fall.

39
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,196
What would this look like from inside a plane that is also in freefall?

40
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:18,878
Because they're falling with the plane, the balls appear to be floating inside.

41
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:25,934
Yet, horizontal balls move together, and vertical balls move apart.

42
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:32,253
Even in 'zero-g,' the balls move as if acting on their own.

43
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:41,589
Gravity is supposed to be indistinguishable from acceleration, yet inside that falling plane, there's still movement.

44
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:50,939
This is tidal force—the real gravitational effect caused by gravity varying from one point to another.

45
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:57,241
This same tidal force is what causes the ocean tides.

46
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:06,289
The moon's gravity is stronger on the side of Earth facing it than the side away. That difference pulls on the sea.

47
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:13,037
'Spaghettification' near a black hole is just an extreme example of this tidal force.

48
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:24,913
Near a black hole, the difference in gravity between your head and feet is so massive you'd be stretched out like a noodle.

49
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:36,574
Tidal force is the 'true' gravity; measuring it tells you if you are actually in a gravitational field.

50
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:44,494
Now for the main point: this tidal force IS spacetime curvature.

51
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:55,174
Recall the two balls: horizontal ones drifted together, while vertical ones drifted apart.

52
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:03,747
To an observer in freefall, they seem to move despite there being no local gravity.

53
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:11,050
That is exactly what we mean when we say spacetime is curved.

54
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:18,182
On flat paper, parallel lines stay parallel. But in curved space, they don't.

55
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:27,556
The spherical Earth is a perfect example. We call the path of a freefalling object a 'geodesic'.

56
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:37,415
A geodesic is the shortest path in curved spacetime. A falling object follows this straightest possible path.

57
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:51,159
The change in distance between two geodesics is called 'geodesic deviation.' The balls moving is just that.

58
00:06:56,866 --> 00:07:05,602
In the 19th century, Bernhard Riemann created a mathematical way to describe how these lines converge or diverge.

59
00:07:05,702 --> 00:07:09,134
This is today's star: Riemann Curvature.

60
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:20,618
Riemann curvature measures how much two nearby falling objects accelerate toward or away from each other.

61
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:29,198
Einstein realized that Riemann curvature is the curvature of spacetime, which is gravity itself.

62
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:38,658
Tidal forces arise from geodesic deviation; the more spacetime curves, the stronger the tidal force.

63
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:52,037
Tidal forces, geodesic deviation, and Riemann curvature are just different ways to describe the same concept.

64
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:59,317
So, the rise and fall of the tides is actually a everyday sign of spacetime curvature.

65
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:07,286
If you enjoy fishing, you could say you're out there reacting to the curvature of spacetime.

66
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:15,349
To understand curvature even better, let's look at parallel transport.

67
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,064
Even simple movement across curved spacetime leads to strange results.

68
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,388
Imagine you're in a room, pointing south, and you walk in a circle.

69
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,560
If you keep pointing south and return to the start, your finger is still pointing in the original direction, right?

70
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,832
That seems obvious, but on a curved surface like Earth, something else happens.

71
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:53,946
Stand at the North Pole, point south, and walk down to the equator.

72
00:08:55,633 --> 00:09:03,361
At the equator, walk 90 degrees east along the line while still pointing your finger in that same direction.

73
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,664
Then, head straight back up to the North Pole. What direction are you pointing now?

74
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:16,020
Incredibly, your finger is now 90 degrees off from where it started.

75
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:26,562
Even though you never 'turned' your hand, the direction changed. That is another definition of curved space.

76
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:36,391
You can't maintain the same orientation if the space you're moving through is curved.

77
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:46,849
We used the Earth as an example, but spacetime curves the same way around massive objects like black holes.

78
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:57,026
Gravity can appear to vanish in a falling plane, making it seem like it's gone.

79
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:04,606
But tidal force is the essential gravitational effect that cannot be erased.

80
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:14,322
Riemann curvature describes this mathematically, and Einstein used it to define spacetime curvature in general relativity.

81
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:23,514
Even the tides in the ocean are connected to the very essence of gravity. Until next time!

82
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:30,000
See you in the next video. Have a good day!
