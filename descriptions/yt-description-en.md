# The Heart of General Relativity Is Tidal Force? — Understanding Spacetime Curvature through Free Fall!

If you drop two balls side by side at the same time, they fall in parallel and never collide, right?
Actually, that's not quite true. Beyond this small question lies the heart of general relativity: the curvature of spacetime.

In this video, we use "tidal force" — the part of gravity that can't be eliminated even in free fall — as a key to intuitively and visually explain what spacetime curvature (Riemann curvature) really is, without any equations.

🔍 What you'll learn in this video:
・ How gravity "disappears" in free fall — the Equivalence Principle
・ The true nature of gravity that can't be removed — Tidal Force
・ The connection between tidal force and spacetime curvature (Riemann curvature)
・ The curious phenomena caused by parallel transport in curved space

🔔 This video is for you if:
・ You're interested in general relativity but find the math intimidating
・ You can't quite picture what "curved spacetime" means
・ You want to learn more about how tidal forces and gravity work
